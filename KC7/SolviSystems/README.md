# About
- SolviSystems is a fictional SaaS company in KC7's SolviSystems module
- From 2024-05-01 to 2024-05-29, an unidentified threat actor launched a successful, multi-stage attack against SolviSystems. 
- As a result, sensitive information about the DOCKS-ICS software, SolviSystem's primary SaaS product that numerous energy companies rely on, was compromised

   - goes through my investigative proces
   - breaks down each stage of the intrusion
   - contains resources for defending against similar intrusions--atomic Indicators of Compromise, a (MITRE ATT&CK) attack flow of the intrusion, and MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques observed in the attack.
