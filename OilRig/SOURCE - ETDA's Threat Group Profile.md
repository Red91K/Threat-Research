Source Reliability: 
- Verdict: moderately reliable
   - reliable as a **secondary source** given the reputable sources they draw upon & a lack of understandable incentives, as a threat research team under a Thailand governmental agency, to misrepresent information about OilRig
   - but, does not provide citations for many assertions which is especially concerning as a secondary source
- ETDA (Electronic Transactions Development Agency) is a Thailand government agency
- the threat profile is part of a project that aims to create threat profiles for "all [threat actor] groups worldwide"
- Not necessarily famous as a Threat Intelligence producer, but records show they track multiple threat actors & have published a lot of research
- ETDA states that they track threat actors exclusively using OSINT, mainly from the following sources: MISP Threat Actors galaxy, MITRE ATT&CK Groups, Malpedia, AlienVault OTX. 
- ETDA states that they "play a strictly neutral role and everything collected in this portal does in no way signify specific endorsements, placing blame on countries or taking sides."
