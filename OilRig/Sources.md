### Who is OilRig? 
- General information
- Attribution
- Capabilities

-> Hackers are not all the same; they range in skill, resources, and capability and often go by different names. How would you classify this threat actor? Do they go by any aliases? Where are they from? How would you rate the skill level and resources available to this threat actor? 

- Intent /Motivation
- Geopolitical context

-> Hackers are motivated to act for specific reasons. What are the motivations of your threat actor? What is the specific geo-political context they are operating in and what insight does that give you for why they are operating in this manner? 

### What are OilRig's TTPs?
Hackers utilize specific tradecraft, tactics, and processes to act on their motivations. Describe the range of efforts used by your threat actor to engage in the hacking process. Utilize the Lockheed Martin Kill Chain to help describe those efforts.

Hackers utilize the hacking process to achieve certain “end-effects” on their target. Provide examples or case studies of attacks your threat actor has been involved with over the years and describe their primary, secondary, and second order effects.

### Defensive reccomendations?
Not all hackers represent a strategic problem for policy makers. How would you characterize your threat actor, are they chiefly a private problem for businesses or a public concern for policy makers? How should policy makers respond?
